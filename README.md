# Practical2: Data Mining

Use data structures from the Java Collections framework to implement a (very simplified) version of a text mining application.
The idea is to analyse the lexical content of the book “Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland” by Lewis Carroll to extract the frequency of word occurrences.  
Studies such as these help to understand the author’s writing style, the period of when the book was written, changes in word spellings over the year etc. 

You may want to refer to the documentation for the [Java APIs](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/index.html) when trying to decide which is the most appropriate data structure to use.
In particular, refer to the [Java Collections framework](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/util/package-summary.html#CollectionsFramework).
